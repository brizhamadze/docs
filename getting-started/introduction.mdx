# Navigating Your Workspace

MedSpace uses a powerful **three-panel layout** designed for speed and clarity.

<Frame caption="The HealthTech Interface: Spaces (Left), Content (Middle), AI (Right)">
  {/* Placeholder for layout overview image */}
  <div className="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-8 text-center rounded-lg">
    [Layout Overview Image will be placed here]
  </div>
</Frame>

## 1. The Left Panel: Navigation
On the far left, you'll find your **Spaces List** (vertical strip) and the **Folder Tree**.
- **Spaces:** Switch between different clinics or personal workspaces.
- **Folder Tree:** Navigate through your patient records and document folders.

## 2. The Middle Panel: Your Workspace
This is where the work happens.
- **Folder View:** When you select a folder, you see its contents here.
- **Viewer:** When you open a file (PDF, DICOM), this panel transforms into the viewer.

## 3. The Right Panel: AI Companion
Your always-on assistant lives here.
- **Context Aware:** It knows what document you are looking at.
- **Actionable:** Use it to summarize findings or draft reports.

<Note>
  **Pro Tip:** You can resize these panels by dragging the dividers to suit your workflow.
