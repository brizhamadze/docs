# Spaces Overview

Spaces are independent workspaces within MedSpace. You might have a **Personal Space** for your private patients and separate **Clinic Spaces** for organizations you work with.

## Switching Spaces

You can switch between spaces using the **Vertical Navigation Bar** on the far left of the screen.

    Look for the vertical strip on the far left edge of the application.

  <Step title="Select a Space">
    Click on the icon representing the space you want to enter (e.g., your initials for Personal Space, or a clinic logo).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    The **Folder Tree** (left panel) will update to show patients and documents for that specific space.
